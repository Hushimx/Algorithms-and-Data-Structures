# Algorithms and Data Structures

Welcome to my algorithms and data structures repository! This repository contains implementations of algorithms and data structures that I've learned from Colt Steele's course on Udemy.

## Introduction

I've been learning about algorithms and data structures through Colt Steele's comprehensive course on Udemy. This repository serves as my personal collection of implementations in JavaScript based on the concepts covered in the course. It's a great resource for reinforcing what I've learned and for quick reference.

## Contents

In this repository, you'll find the following files:

- [Algorithms](./algorithms): Contains JavaScript implementations of various algorithms covered in the course.
- [Data Structures](./datastructures): Includes JavaScript implementations of fundamental data structures as taught by Colt Steele.
